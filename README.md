## Running the application

### Cloud Platform
 http://bookstore2021-env-1.eba-h9nj3uua.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/main 
 This is hosted on AWS (We have encountered some problems where after a time period their would be a problem loading resources, should this encounter either 1. Wait a bit or 2. Contact us and we will refresh our instance on AWS)

### Local Host
Import the [war ](https://github.com/khallman97/4413-2021/blob/main/War%20Files/Bookstore.war) file into eclipse enterprise 
From there, run our application inside eclipse which will then be available on your local host

## Testing

Download the [TestPlan.jmx](https://github.com/khallman97/4413-2021/tree/main/Load%20Testing%20Setup%20and%20Results/JMeter%20Test%20File) and open it inside of jmeter. After this hit the run button to and check the summery results as well as full results to see load testing.
